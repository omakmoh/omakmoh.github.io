Experienced Cybersecurity Engineer specializing in network, web application, and mobile penetration testing. With experience in scripting and programming, I have a keen eye for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in complex systems. <br>

My accomplishments include winning the Arab regional CTF competition twice in a row, as well as being acknowledged by Sony, RedBull, Nubank, TopCoder, and Nokia for discovering bugs in their systems.<br>

I am always seeking new challenges to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest security threats and countermeasures.
